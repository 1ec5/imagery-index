# imagery-index

ðŸ›° An index of aerial and satellite imagery useful for mapping.


### About the index

#### tl;dr

To add an imagery source to the index:

* Add source `.json` files under the `sources/` folder
  * Each file contains info about the imagery source: name, url template, license requirements
  * Each file also contains info about which locations the imagery covers. The locations can be country or region codes, points, or custom `.geojson` files in the `features/*` folder.
  * You can copy and change an existing file to get started.
* Run `npm run test`
  * This will check the files for errors and make them pretty.
  * If you don't have Node installed, you can skip this step and we will do it for you.
* If there are no errors, submit a pull request.
